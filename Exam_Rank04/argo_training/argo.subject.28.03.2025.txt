Assignment name: argo
Expected files: argo.c
Allowed functions: getc, ungetc, printf, malloc, calloc, 
realloc, free, isdigit, fscanf, write
-----------------
Write a function argo that will parse a json file in the 
structure declared in argo.h:

int	argo(json *dst, FILE *stream);

	dst	- is the pointer to the AST that you will create
	stream	- is the file to parse (man FILE)

Your function will return 1 for success and -1 for failure.
If the key is missing and only the value is present, the function must
return -1. You don't have to handle spaces between (...) in the input 
(so they should be considered as invalid tokens.) You can have spaces 
inside double quotes, i.e. inside strings.
If an unexpected token is found you will print the following 
message in stdout:
"Unexpected token '%c'\n"
or if the token is EOF:
"Unexpected end of input\n"

In case of doubt how to parse json, read rfc8259. But you won't 
need it as the format is simple. Tested with the main, 
the output should be exactly the same as the input 
(except for errors).
There are some functions in argo.c that might help you.

Examples that should work:

echo -n input | ./argo /dev/stdin | cat -e			output
------------------------------------------			--------------------------------------------
'1'													1$
'"bonjour"'											"bonjour"$
'"escape!\""'										"escape!\""$
'{"tomatoes":42,"potatoes":234}'					{"tomatoes": 42, "potatoes: 234}$
'{"recursion":{"recursion":{"recursion":"Value"}}}'	{"recursion":{"recursion":{"recursion":"Value"}}}$
'"unfinished string'								Unexpected end of input$
'"unfinished string 2\"'							Unexpected end of input$
'{"no value?":}'									Unexpected token '}'$
{ "spaces" : "between tokens" }						Unexpected token ' '$
